# 📊 Business Analytics with Excel: E-Commerce Profitability Analysis (2024–2025)

## Business Context


In this project, I work on dummy data to analyze the financial performance of an e-commerce company. The business context is that while sales are increasing, profits have started to stagnate. I also propose data-driven recommendations for 2026.

## 🎯 Objectives

I structured the project into 4 tasks:

1. Clean and prepare the data  
2. Build a dynamic P&L dashboard (2024–2025 comparison)  
3. Analyze product-level performance  
4. Present executive recommendations

  - Pivot Tables
  - Financial modeling (Gross Profit, EBIT, EBITDA)
  - Dynamic dropdown dashboard

---

## 📂 Task 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning

Before jumping into the numbers, I:

- Reviewed how the dataset was structured  
- Separated combined fields into usable columns  
- Checked for missing values and data inconsistencies  
- Ensured financial calculations (COGS, marketing, taxes) were accurate

## 📈 Task 2: Company Financial Performance (2024 vs 2025)

I built a dynamic P&L dashboard allowing year selection.

### Key Results

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | YoY Change |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| Net Sales | $716,765 | $778,997 | +8.7% |
| Gross Margin | 33.9% | 31.7% | ↓ 6.5% |
| Net Earnings | $104,099 | $104,374 | +$275 |
| Marketing Spend | $36,599 | $40,484 | +10.6% |

---

### 🔎 Findings:

- Sales grew ~8.7% in 2025  
- COGS grew faster (~12.3%)  
- Gross margin declined from **33.9% → 31.7%**  
- Marketing spend increased by 10.6%  
- Net earnings remained almost flat  

**Conclusion:**  
Sales grew, but gross margin fell from 33.9% → 31.7%, indicating COGS pressure.

## 📉 EBIT & EBITDA Analysis

- EBIT and EBITDA remained nearly unchanged year over year  
- The close alignment between EBIT and EBITDA suggests business model has limited depreciation and amortization due to less assets, which aligns with the "drop-shipping" model of the company

## 🛍 Task 3: Product-Level Performance

To understand *where* profit was leaking, I analyzed each product individually.

### Units Sold

- **Product 3:** Strong growth driver  
- **Product 1:** Moderate growth  
- **Product 2:** Declining sales  

---

### Peak Single-Day Sales

Product 3 recorded the highest single-day demand in both 2024 and 2025.

This confirms strong and consistent customer demand.

---

## 💡 Task 4: Recommendations for 2026

### 1️⃣ Protect Gross Margins

- Renegotiate supplier pricing for Products 1 & 3  
- Consider selective price increases on high-demand SKUs (esp. Product 3), to offset rising COGS without materially impacting volume.

---

### 2️⃣ Reassess Product 2

- Reduce or pause marketing spend for Product 2
- Do comprehensive cost analysis breakdown for Product 2
- Allocate incremental marketing spend toward Product 3
- Test bundling Product 3 with Product 1 to lift margins

---

### 3️⃣ Improve Marketing Efficiency

- Prioritize marketing spend on Product 1 (highest profitability growth) and Product 3 (highest demand and volume), while reducing spend on Product 2
- Run AB tests on offering Product 1 as a premium offering
- Reduce spend during low-margin months

---

## Files Included

- Excel dashboard (dynamic P&L + product analysis)  
- Executive presentation summarizing findings
